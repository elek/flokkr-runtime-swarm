# Runnng Apache Hadoop/Spark/other bigdata on Docker swarm

This repository contains example configuration and docker definition to run the flokkr docker images (Hadoop/Spark/Hive/...) on docker swarm cluster. 

## Getting started

After creating a docker swarm cluster (with `docker swarm init` and `docker swarm join`).

Choose a subdirectory and deploy it:

```
cd ozone
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yaml ozone
```

Check the stacks/services:

```
docker stack ls
docker stack ps ozone
docker service ls
```

Scale:

```
docker service scale datanode=10
```
